  # She then gives user#2 acess to "foo".  user#2 already has a collection called "foo", but this collection is never
  # saved, so there is no error thrown (and if there were, what would it say?).  User#2 then tries to add an icon to
  # the new "foo", but it fails because the name of the collection is already taken in the scope of all of its users.
  # ...What would the message say, and why would she care? I don't see any of these messages as clear... or helpful.
  # ...more trouble than it's worth, and the restriction is fairly arbitrary anyway: it's just there for the clarity
  # of the user.  Now the user needs to manage this by themselves.
